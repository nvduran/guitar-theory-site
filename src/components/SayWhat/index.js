        There are several variations of the pentatonic scale, including the
        major and minor pentatonic. The major pentatonic scale has a bright,
        happy sound and is made up of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, and 6th notes of
        the major scale. The minor pentatonic scale has a slightly darker, more
        melancholy sound and is made up of the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 7th notes
        of the natural minor scale.
