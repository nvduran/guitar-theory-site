      <h1>What is a pentatonic scale?</h1>
      <p>
        A pentatonic scale is a musical scale with five notes per octave, in
        contrast to the heptatonic scale, which has seven notes per octave (such
        as the major scale and minor scale). Pentatonic scales are very common
        and can be found in a variety of musical traditions around the world.

        The pentatonic scale has a unique sound that is often described as
        "open" or "relaxed." It is commonly used in folk, blues, and rock music,
        and can also be found in classical and jazz compositions. The pentatonic
        scale is a great tool for improvisation and can be easily incorporated
        into a variety of musical styles.

        There are several variations of the pentatonic scale, including the
        major pentatonic, minor pentatonic, and blues scales. The major
        pentatonic scale has a bright, happy sound and is made up of the 1st,
        2nd, 3rd, 5th, and 6th notes of the major scale. The minor pentatonic
        scale has a slightly darker, more melancholy sound and is made up of the
        1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 7th notes of the natural minor scale. The blues
        scale is a variation of the minor pentatonic scale with an added "blue
        note" (a flatted 5th).
